## About

The Amethyst Imperial Grand is a free digitally modeled piano library providing a rich "imperial" sound.
With the use of high quality lossless FLAC samples and dynamic filtering, this library aims to produce a realistic yet powerful tone while keeping a logically small size.
There are two types of presets to choose from: the Studio presets which include a dry and clean sound of the piano, as well as the Imperial Hall presets which place the piano in a large royal room providing a pleasant reverberant sound.
For each type you can also find string accompaniment presets which will also generate a string ensemble sound with each note.
The library is written in the SFZ format which makes it easy to modify and tweak to your liking and use with any synthesizer of your choice.
