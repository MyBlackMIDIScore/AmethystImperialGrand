## About this soundfont

The Amethyst Imperial Grand is sampled from the well-known Yamaha C7 Grand Piano. This soundfont is specifically optimized and equalized to be used for Black MIDI playback, but can also work well on other cases (such as live piano playback or piano transcriptions). The soundfont consists of 88 lossless FLAC samples, for the best sound quality possible. There are a total of 20 default dynamic velocity layers for realism, as well as a preset pack with 128 velocity layers (created by Bribi/Kep for his Steinway B-211 soundfont project). You can find a total of 44 SFZ presets, so you can find exactly the sound you are looking for! There are also some interesting addon packs. One of them is a selection of string samples mixed with the piano to give it a “dreamy” or “fantasy” feel, while the other one uses the samples from the infamous XP-80 Super piano soundfont, as well as its fantasy sound pack.
